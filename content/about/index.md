> A decade trying to make the world a better place, a byte at a time

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a seasoned software engineer with a decade of experience, passionate about crafting cutting-edge, secure, and performant software. Specializing in backend development, I excel in architecting robust server-side solutions with a focus on Node. While backend is my stronghold, I'm adept at contributing to engaging frontends in React when needed. Proficient in DevOps and AWS tools, I derive satisfaction from shaping CI/CD pipelines and orchestrating deployments for efficient workflows.

During the day, I'm creating and deploying serverless applications using AWS CDK. By night, I am playing with Golang and Rust, drawn to their simplicity, efficiency, and performance benefits. Beyond coding, I find inspiration in mountaineering, honing not only my fear of heights but also fostering team management skills crucial in software engineering. Excited about integrating Golang and Rust into my toolkit, I look forward to contributing to innovative projects that leave a lasting impact.
