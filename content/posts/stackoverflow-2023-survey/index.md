**Stackoverflow 2023 Survey Personal Opinions**

## Context

The mamoth and elixir source of all developer oriented questions, [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) holds an annual [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
This trove of information brings insight since 2011 and you can download `.csv` the full data sets with the results from their official page.

I find it interesting to skim through the results and observe the current tendencies and changes in the tooling ecosystem.
Here are some things I look foward when looking at the results:

- How job is affected by demographics and tooling?
- It there any significant shift in the tooling in the last few years that will impact 
- What is the ecosystem of engineers that work in the same field as me, or in a field that I aspire to be in a couple of years, composed of?
- What is the trend in the community, demographics and work that could potentially affect me?

In this piece I will try to be as impartial as possible, conserving my personal thoughts to myself, and just note observations from the survey.

If this is something that could interest you, follow allong.
